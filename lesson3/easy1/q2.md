# Question 2
Describe the difference between `!` and `?` in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:
- When placed before an expression, `!` is a negation operator. It returns 
  `false` if the expression is truthy, and `true` if the expression is falsy.
- When placed at the end of a method name, `!` is a bang operator. In Ruby
  convention, it indicates that the method is more dangerous than its non-bang
  counterpart. Not every destructive method ends in bang.
- When used in a ternary operator, `?` evalutes the truthiness of the 
  conditional.
- When placed at the end of a method name, `?` indicates a predicate method.
  By convention, the method returns `true` or `false`.
- When placed before a character, `?` returns the ASCII code for that 
  character.

1. what is `!=` and where should you use it?

  - `!=` is the inequality operator. It is used in conditionals to evaluate 
    whether the two operand are not equal to each other.

2. put ! before something, like !user_name

  - Returns `false` if the operand is truthy, and `true` if falsy.

3. put ! after something, like words.uniq!

  - Invokes the destructive version of the method (if it exists).

4. put ? before something

  - Returns the ASCII code for that character.

5. put ? after something

  - Used in ternary operator.

6. put !! before something, like !!user_name

  - Return `true` if the expression is truthy, or `false` if falsy.
